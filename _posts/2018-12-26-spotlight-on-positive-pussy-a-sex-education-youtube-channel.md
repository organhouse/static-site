<p>A woman in her early twenties, Maggie, sits in a loose T-shirt and <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">little  </g><g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="9" data-gr-id="9"><g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">makeup</g>,</g> and talks straight to the camera. She’s calm and confident and rambles a little bit. She doesn't follow a script because she doesn’t need to — you can tell she’s quite the expert on this topic. In this video  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M278eEBGSHU&amp;t=752s">this video</a>, titled “Let’s talk about blow jobs!” Maggie talks about penile anatomy and pleasure, and I definitely learned a few things.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing that stands out are the characters in her narrative. She talks about &nbsp;your experience, as a person performing a blow-job, and the penis receiving the blow job. She only refers to the other person in this situation —&nbsp;you know, the one connected to that penis — as the “penis-owner.” They are there to provide exactly one thing —&nbsp;a “feedback loop” about whether or not this particular penis is digging what you’re doing. It’s presented entirely as a fun activity for YOU to enjoy, as the “not-job” giver — an achievement to unlock and a skill to take pride in. It’s a really refreshing change of perspective from cosmo-style “how to please your man” advice. This is about you, and your experience, confidence, and pleasure. I can’t think of a more feminist message than that, or a bigger confidence boost for anyone wanting to learn about giving great blow-jobs. <br></p>

<p>Maggie is beautiful, sweet, and funny, but also notably well spoken the topic of sex. That isn’t an accident —&nbsp;she’s devoted her short adult life to sex education and recently completed <a href="http://sfsi.org/training/">SFSI’s Sex Educator Training</a>. She’s also busy. In the 6 months that her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHhg4rJv2WnvJ3zLVfSlgAA">YouTube channel</a> has been active, she’s created almost 40 educational videos. She records these live most tuesday evenings.<br></p>

<p>One  20-minute video on kitten play, my personal favorite,  goes into <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="3" data-gr-id="3">a really understandable explanations</g> of aspects of BDSM that can often be more intimidating than intriguing —  D/s relationship dynamics, pet play, and age play. Others start with the very basics — birth control options, and how to properly put on a condom.<br></p>

<p>Another video starts with a slightly cringe-worthy but entirely hilarious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onSnuM19IEw">rap about vulva</a>, written by Maggie herself:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Where to begin? Let’s start outside going in! / Vulva have a mons pubis / some outer lips and inner lips / inside all this, at the top / is the clitoris / there’s also two holes / that have different roles / the urethra is for pee / it’s the smaller one, you’ll see! / And hole number two / is a part of the vulva crew / but just the opening / the inside is a different thing! / That’s the difference between / a vulva a vagina / a vulva you can see / a vagina is inside ya.”  </p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maggie speaks about almost every taboo topic —&nbsp;cannabis and sex, her diagnosis with depression and anxiety, butt plugs, BDSM, side effects of birth control, and —&nbsp;in my book, the kinkiest of all — monogamy.<br></p>
