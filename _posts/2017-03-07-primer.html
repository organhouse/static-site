excerpt: You’ve finally gotten an invite to the elusive event. But what things do
  experienced orgy-ists know that you don’t? How can you look like you belong there?
  Here is our best advice for navigating your first play party like a pro.
---
<p>You’ve read about it in magazines. Your prettier, cooler friend went to one in Amsterdam and talks about it all the time. But the last straw was having to drink after “never have I ever been to a sex party!” <em>(Editors note — I've been informed that I've been playing “Never have I ever” incorrectly. Oops.)</em></p>
<p>It’s time.</p>
<p>You’ve found a hookup and finally gotten an invite. But what things do experienced orgy-ists know that you don’t? How can you look like you belong there? Here are some things that can help you feel more comfortable and confident attending your first sex party.</p>
<h2>1. Find a Partner.</h2>
<p>Don’t go solo, for safety’s sake. Ask the organizers if you’re permitted a +1 and if so, how they prefer you extend an invitation. They may want to talk to your partner ahead of time, to make sure they’re comfortable inviting this person. Your partner for the evening doesn’t have to be a date; you can just bring a friend who wants to check it out. (Unless the rules of the party state otherwise.)</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_301" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-301 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/giphy-4.gif" alt="Speechless man reacts to an invitation to a sex party." width="500" height="286" /> “So… I need a date for this sex party.”[/caption]</p>
<h2>2. Don’t have expectations, but know what you’re hoping to gain from this experience.</h2>
<p>What are you actually hoping to find at this party? If the answer is just “sex” that’s okay, but your answer might be more complicated than that. “I’d like to meet other people who do this so I can find out if they are normal and I am normal for wanting to do this.” Or maybe, “I’d like to finally get to show off this amazing lingerie I bought and feel super confident in.” Or, “I’d like to watch my partner do something specific with another person.” Do some soul searching. What it is that intrigues you about this opportunity, and what you are hoping to learn or gain by attending?</p>
<p>Talk with your partner about it, too. What are they hoping to find? Is it something completely different? Are your individual goals in competition? Example: I want to watch my partner play with someone else, but they only wants us to play with each other. Am I alright with that?</p>
<h2>3. Negotiate your boundaries</h2>
<p>Set boundaries with your partner ahead of time. Do you plan to play together, if the opportunity arises? What would you be happy to try, and what’s off limits? This list is probably a different list than if you were in the privacy of your own home, so make time to discuss it. Here are some questions to start the conversation:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
<li>Are you comfortable being naked at the party? Are you comfortable with your partner being naked?</li>
<li>Is kissing other people okay?</li>
<li>Are you comfortable playing at the party? (“Play” is a common code word for having sex.)</li>
<li>Are you planning on playing together?</li>
<li>Would you be upset if your partner played with someone else without you?</li>
<li>Are you planning on playing together, and inviting others to join you?</li>
<li>How would you feel if you guys ended up playing in two separate groups of people all night?</li>
<li>How would you feel if your partner got tons of attention and you didn’t?</li>
<li>What are you most afraid of happening?</li>
<li>What are you most excited about happening?</li>
</ul>
<p>Negotiating boundaries is crucial to your being able to navigate a public play space. But also realize that you won’t think of everything. You’re both choosing to walk hand-in-hand into a grey area. Try to agree beforehand that if something upsetting happens, you’re going to talk through it together. These are difficult conversations, but they are enlightening and empowering. Sometimes, sexual liberation takes hard work.</p>

But I won’t do that. ”" width="504" height="332" /> Literally, anything except that.[/caption]</p>
<h2>4. Checking in</h2>
<p>Do you have a code word or a way to “check in” with each other if one of you is feeling uneasy? I simply walk up to my husband and say, “hey, let’s check in” if I need to ask him something or remind him that he’s close to one of our boundaries. Your rules, and your way of checking in with each other may be different. Find something that works for you, and agree on it before the party. Even if your partner is a friend and not a date, you should have a way to get each other’s attention if one of you needs the other.</p>
<h2>5. Understand the risks</h2>
<p>Sex is not risk-free. Are you attending a party where all guests provided STD test results? If the organizers didn't ask you to provide recent test results, they didn’t ask anyone else to do that, either. What risks are you willing to take? Would kissing and cuddling be okay, but penetration is off-limits? Is penetration fine as long as you use condoms? Are you planning on using dental dams and are they provided, or do you need to bring your own? Were you tested recently enough to know that you’re not causing someone to take a risk they aren’t aware of? If one of you gets sick, what next? It’s never rude to ask someone their status and how recently they were tested. Go ahead and bring it up.</p>
<h2>6. Have a plan</h2>
<p>Know when to call it quits, and have a way to let each other know that you need to leave. Always remember, you do not have to check off your entire bucket list in one night. There WILL be other parties. You will probably run into the same people again. If one of you needs to end the evening, respect each other’s needs first and foremost. You want to negotiate your boundaries sober, ahead of time, when there is no pressure. Don't try to renegotiate those boundaries in the heat of the moment. That is sure to backfire and hurt someone’s feelings.</p>
<h2>7. Read and memorize the House Rules</h2>
<p>No red wine, because they have white carpet? Do you need to ask before touching other guests? Is the master bedroom off limits for playing? Are you allowed to shower, but only if you brought your own towel? Make sure you are aware of all the house rules so you don’t accidentally break them. Plus, if you don’t like the rules, don’t go! These parties are becoming more popular. You’ll likely find another one with rules that make you feel more comfortable.</p>
<h2>8. Grooming</h2>
<p>Shower as close to the event as possible. I recommend carefully washing your nethers and trimming hair. Ladies, don’t feel obligated to shave it all off down there. Trimming is totally acceptable. For safety reasons, it’s unwise to shave immediately before a party. If you get a tiny cut while shaving, you may be making yourself more susceptible to STD transmission. If you want it all bare, I recommend getting waxed or sugared the day before. And unless you are a seasoned flosser, I also don’t recommend that you floss day-of, for the same concern.</p>
<p>Don’t wear scents. Sexytime gets hot and sweaty, so newbs are often compelled to pile on the Axe body spray. Please, for the love of god, don’t do this. Everyone knows you’re new. And it’s rude. Some people have allergies, most people just don’t like Axe body spray.</p>
<h2>9. Allergies to pets?</h2>
<p>Bring your allergy meds. Many play parties take place in private homes, and they may have pets. Do not do that thing where you ask if they can lock the cat in a bedroom. The cat lives there; you don’t. You are the cat’s guest. Take your allergy meds and deal.<br />

<h2>10. Viagra</h2>
<p>A lot of guys take Viagra before parties. Even young guys. Something about being in a crowd keeps your brain on alert and causes problems for a lot of people. Don’t be embarrassed if this happens to you. It’s just a thing that happens more commonly at parties. If you think you’ll need it, talk to a doctor beforehand. Never take medication that isn’t prescribed to you, and never take medication from others, especially people you don’t know well.</p>
<h2>11. Dress nicely!</h2>
<p>Be clean and presentable! Don’t spend money on a new outfit, but you should look like you’re trying a little bit. I would arrive fully clothed, and not only be wearing lingerie under a jacket. That’s a cool look, but if you get there and don’t feel comfortable baring that much, you’ll have a shirt to put back on. I usually end up in my underwear and a pair of pasties. I don’t like wearing a bra, but I also don’t like being 100% bare up top. Pasties are a great option. Expensive lingerie is usually not worth it. It comes off pretty quick, and clothing is frequently lost at these events. Don’t bring any jewelry or clothing that you’d be devastated to lose. It's easy for items to end up in the wrong pile at the end of the night. If you’re on a tight budget but want to feel presentable, solid black underwear is a go-to staple.<br />

<h2>11. Arrive discreetly, on time</h2>
<p>It may be fashionable, but it’s ill-advised to arrive late. It’s much easier to acclimate yourself to the environment when you arrive on time. Everyone is still sober, clothed, and it feels like a regular cocktail party. This allows you to meet a bunch of people quickly in a low-pressure way. It also gives you the option of “noping” out of there elegantly if you decide this isn’t for you. “Damn! The babysitter called; a pipe burst. We’ve got to run!” feels less jarring when everyone is still mingling over the cheese platter.</p>
<p>Do not talk loudly as you arrive or leave. Give the neighbors zero reason to take interest in this event. Do not ask random people standing on the street “are you here for the sex party?” Don’t loiter, fiddling with your phone looking for the door code or address. Be respectful of the risk your hosts might be taking, and help them reduce that risk.</p>
<h2>12. Don’t talk work</h2>
<p>If someone else brings up their employment, that’s fine. But the usual pleasantries of “Hi! I’m first name, last name.” or “So what do you do?” may not be appropriate. Some people are not comfortable sharing personal details at a sex party. Some even use pseudonyms to protect their careers. What CAN you talk about? Sex! “Hey guys, this is actually my first time here! I’d love to meet your friends, and find someone to try [insert fantasy] with!” Other great topics: what was the craziest night of your life before tonight? Where have you traveled, and where would you love to go? What’s your latest guilty pleasure? Favorite book?</p>
<h2>13. Don’t talk politics</h2>
<p>There are a lot of touchy subjects that you or I may consider “politics,” and up for debate. But for some play-party-goers, these topics hit close to home. For some, like sex workers or people who identify as queer, etc., these issues don’t feel like politics. They feel like human rights that are being violated. If you disagree with these lifestyles and orientations, you may find it difficult to find common ground with other guests. You'll also encounter strong opinions about affordable access to contraception and abortions. Unless you're going to talk about marching in Washington for women's rights with your 91-year-old grandmother, just don’t bring it up.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/giphy.gif" alt="Samantha from sex and the city says, “I don't believe in the republican party or the democratic party. I just believe in parties.”" width="500" height="364" /></p>
<h2>14. Don’t assume someone’s orientation or gender.</h2>
<p>The men are not all straight; the women are not all bi. And in some uber liberal places, you may cause offense if you assume someone who presents as female goes by she/her/hers pronouns and visa versa. Be aware that the crowd may not conform to your expectations. You are going to a sex party to expand your sexual horizons, so be open to learning new things.</p>
<h2>15. Do not take pictures</h2>
<p>Never, ever pull out a camera and take pictures at a play party. You might have the permission of the people front and center in the picture, but what about people in the background? Even if they’re clothed, that pic could cost them their job. It’s extremely rude to start taking pictures in what’s supposed to be a safe space where guests can let their guard down. Many parties will kick you out for a first offense. Some places say pictures are okay, but I advise you to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>If you’re a journalist, and you’re specifically trying to get pictures, try telling the hosts what you want. If a journalist reached out to me, we’d simply host a party where everyone attending knows it’s being documented. Hosts can work with you ahead of time to keep everyone feeling good about the plan. Access exists, but being dishonest will not get you the inside scoop.</p>
<h2>16. Be polite and straightforward</h2>
<p>If someone asks to play and you're not interested, you can always just say “No thank you.” Don’t say “maybe” or “later” and hope they’ll get the hint. They may not get the hint, but they’ll understand “no thank you.” It’s perfectly polite, and you don’t owe them an explanation about why you said no. If someone starts pestering you or approaching you after you’ve already said no, that’s a different story. Then you don’t have to be polite. But the best course of action there is to alert on of the event organizers of that situation.</p>
<h2>17. Do not take something you’ve never tried</h2>
<p>The logic always seems to be “well, I’ve never been to a sex party before, I guess i’ll take this pill that I’ve never tried before, too!” You will be the reason that a few very irritated people have to stop having sex, put on clothes, and carry you outside to puke and get fresh air, and escort you home in a taxi. You will very likely not be invited back. Imbibe in things you’re familiar with, only when you know how they’ll affect you. And don’t do too much of anything.</p>
<h2>18. Stay safe</h2>
<p>Be vigilant of your surroundings, and trust your gut. Responsible, experienced hosts will have put a lot of effort into keeping you safe. But you should still be aware of your surroundings. See open flames? Candles are beautiful, but are a fire hazard. I’d locate the exits. Make sure the exits aren’t blocked by everyone’s bags and purses. Is the host or organizer sober and accessible if you have an issue? If not, have they designated someone as a safe person to go to if there are any issues? Are any of the guests creeping you out? Trust your gut.</p>
<p>If you’re driving home, pick a designated driver ahead of time. If you’re taking public transportation, check when that stops running to make sure you can get home.</p>
<h2>19. Remember — you can just leave.</h2>
<p>Let’s say you immediately regret this decision. That’s okay. Really, it’s okay. The most important part of any kind of sexual exploration is that you’re honest with yourself about what you want. This isn’t for everyone. You can just leave. You don’t owe anyone an explanation. Don’t let anyone pressure you to do something you’re not ready to do. There will ALWAYS be more parties if you need to ease into it. As someone who regularly hosts orgies, I would be much more impressed with a guest who was emotionally mature enough to decide to leave than someone who stays to impress me and ends up drunk or crying in a corner.</p>
<h2>20. Explore! And most importantly, have fun.</h2>
<p>They’re called “play parties” because they should be fun! You’ve put a lot of work into yourself just to be able to attend this event, so enjoy it and reward yourself for that. Have a little champagne, meet new people, start the conga line, and make a memory you’ll never forget. Let yourself feel beautiful and awesome for being the kind of progressive, fun person that goes to sex parties. You deserve it.</p>
