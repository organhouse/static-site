Our trusted friends at the <a href="http://dateablepodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Date/able Podcast</a> were given exclusive access to record our May 2018 event. They followed Nikki, our lovely guest, as she experienced her first event of this kind, and interviewed a few of our members and organizers. “Peaches” gives a particularly colorful play-by-play of what to expect — and not expect! — at your first sex party. ;)

We’re really excited to have a way to give other folks a sneak-peak of how amazing our community is, what we do, and what we stand for. Enjoy!
